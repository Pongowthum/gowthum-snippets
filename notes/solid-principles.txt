SOLID principles 
    - Five design principles in Object Oriented Pragramming
    - Designed for Code maintainability, scalability and robustness


S - Single Responsibility principle
O - Open / Close principle
L - Liskov substitution principle
I - Interface segregation principle
D - Depencency inversion principle

Single Responsibility Principle:
    - A Class should have only one job to do not more than that
    Ex: If there is a class called product, then order must be in a seprate class

Open Close Principle:
    - This principle state that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification
